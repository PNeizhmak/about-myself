### TL;DR
- I'm a team member who share company vision and goals with the teams by giving them shape and evaluated by the effectiveness of the direct managers or teams.
- I'm close working with 'Product' interface to align delivery values and orchestrating technical aspects of product development.
- I ensure the right balance of operational excellence, innovation and speed across teams against company-level goals.
- My role is dynamic enough and behaviour is highly depends on the context.

### Some taste practices/approaches I follow 
- Trust and delegation
- Ongoing feedback
- Skip level activities
- Personal growth

### Key value metrics
- I try to spend up to 10-20% of my time for strategic work
- Impacting using domain and product expertise, innovations, product and technical leadership and mentoring
- All teams deliver with constant and predictable velocity (and improving it through the paradigm of continuous improvement)
- Teams cycle time development should asymptote to 1 day
- All teams constantly adopt new improvements, at least one practice/approach per Q.

### I like
- To work around artefact
- Clear agenda, short and structured meetings
- All types of reports (business, technical)
